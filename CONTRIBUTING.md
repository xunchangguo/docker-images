## Oracle product ownership and responsibility

For any new product content, *you must obtain internal Oracle approvals for the
distribution of this content prior to submitting a pull request*. If you are
unfamiliar with the approval process to submit code to an existing GitHub
repository, please contact the [Oracle Open Source team](mailto:opensource_ww_grp@oracle.com)
for details.

The GitHub user who submits the initial pull request to add a new product image
should add themselves to the [code owner](./CODEOWNERS) file in that same
request. This will flag the user as the owner of the content and any future pull
requests that affect the content will need to be approved by this user.

The code owner will also be assigned to any issues relating to their content.

You must ensure that you check the [issues](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/issues)
on at least a weekly basis, though daily is preferred.

### Pull request process

1. Fork this repository
1. Create a branch in your fork to implement the changes. We recommend using
the issue number as part of your branch name, e.g. `1234-fixes`
1. Ensure that any documentation is updated with the changes that are required
by your fix.
1. Ensure that any samples are updated if the base image has been changed.
1. Submit the pull request. *Do not leave the pull request blank*. Explain exactly
what your changes are meant to do and provide simple steps on how to validate
your changes. Ensure that you reference the issue you created as well.
We will assign the pull request to 2-3 people for review before it is merged.

## Golden Rules

We have some golden rules that we require all submitted `Dockerfiles` to abide
by. These rules are provided by Oracle Global Product Security and may change
at any time.

Most of these are targeted at Oracle employees, but apply to anyone who submits
a pull request.

### Base image rules

1. Extend an existing product image wherever possible. For example, if your
   product requires WebLogic, then extend the WebLogic image instead of creating
   your own WebLogic installation.
1. If you can't extend an existing image, your image must use either the
   `oraclelinux:8` (preferred) or `oraclelinux:7-slim` base image as these images are
   specifically designed to be the smallest possible install size. Both images are
   also updated whenever a security-related errata is published.
   _(Updated Februrary 2021)_
1. There is an `oraclelinux:8-slim` image available for use with statically built
   microservices. It is half the size of `oraclelinux:8` but does not have native
   support for modularity or `dnf`. _Do not use this image if you need to install_
   _any additional packages. (Updated August 2021)._
1. Re-use existing scripts wherever possible. If a particular base image or
   script doesn't have the functionality you need, open an issue and work with
   the image owner to implement it.
1. Specify a version in the `FROM` directive, i.e. use
   `FROM oraclelinux:8` or `FROM java/serverjre:8`.
1. All images must provide a `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`. If your image is designed
   to be extended, then this should output documentation on how to extend the
   image to be useful.
1. Use `LABEL` instructions for additional information such as ports and volumes.
   The following are common label instructions that should be present in all
   images where applicable:

Additional product-specific labels are listed below:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Label   | Value | Applicability |
| -------- | ----- | ------------- |
| provider | `Oracle` | All images |
| issues | `https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/issues` | All images |
| maintainer | Name of the maintainer | At the discretion of the author. |
| volume(.`purpose`) | Use `volume` labels to describe the volumes of an image.
<br/>If your image has multiple volumes, use qualified names to specify the
purpose of each volume, for example `volume.data` for data to be persisted outside
the container.<br/>Use hierarchical nesting for multiple volumes of the same type,
for example:<br/><ul><li>`volume.data.dir1`</li><li>`volume.data.dir2`</li></ul>
| Mandatory for all images that require persistent storage beyond the life of an
individual container. |
| port(.`purpose`) | Use `port` labels to describe the ports of an image.<br/>If
 your images has multiple ports, use qualified names to specify the purpose of
 each port, for example `port.app` for the port on which your application is
 reachable.<br/>Use hierarchical nesting for multiple ports of the same type,
 for example:<br/><ul><li>`port.app.http`</li><li>`port.app.https`</li></ul> |
 Mandatory for all images that require externally accessible port mappings. |
 <!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

For example, for the Oracle Database 18c XE image we use the following labels:

```dockerfile
LABEL "provider"="Oracle"                                   \
      "issues"="https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/issues"         \
      "volume.data"="/opt/oracle/oradata"                               \
      "volume.setup.location1"="/opt/oracle/scripts/setup"              \
      "volume.setup.location2"="/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup"      \
      "volume.startup.location1"="/opt/oracle/scripts/startup"          \
      "volume.startup.location2"="/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/startup"  \
      "port.listener"="1521"                                            \
      "port.oemexpress"="5500"                                          \
      "port.apex"="8080"
```

### Security-related rules

1. Do not require the use of the `--privileged` flag when running a container.
1. Do not run an SSH daemon (`sshd`) inside a container.
1. Do not use host networking mode (`--net=host`) for a container.
1. Do not hard-code any passwords. If passwords are required, generate them
on container startup using `openssl rand` or accept a password argument during
container startup (via `-e`).

### Documentation rules

1. No Oracle host or domain names should be included in any code or examples.
   If an example domain name is required, use `example.com`.
1. All documentation including `README.md` files needs to meet Oracle
   documentation standards. For content submitted by internal Oracle teams,
   it is recommended that your documentation team either write or at least
   review this content. Externally submitted documentation will be reviewed
   during the PR process.
1. Wherever possible, refer to "container images" or just "images" in all
   documentation, as well as in any script output.
1. Only refer to Docker when specifically referring to that product.
1. All build or usage examples should be based on Oracle Linux using either
   [Container Runtime for Docker](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/docker/)
   on Oracle Linux 7 or [Podman](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/podman/)
   on Oracle Linux 8.

### Guidelines and recommendations

The following are some guidelines that will not prevent an image from being
merged, but are generally frowned upon if breached.

* Always aim to produce the smallest possible image. This means using multi-stage
  builds with a final stage using the least amount of layers possible. Combine
  as much as possible within a single directive and be sure to remove any
  cache created by `dnf` or `yum` or other tools.
* Don't install all possible required RPMs, even if the product
  documentation says so. Some RPMs aren't applicable inside a container, e.g
  filesystem utilities (`btrfs-progs`, `ocfs2-tools`, `nfs-utils`).
* Don't install any interactive/user tools, e.g. things like `vim`, `less` or
  `man`. Debugging should be done prior to the image submission.
* Don't install `wget` as the base images already include `curl`.
* Always remember to run `rm -rf /var/cache/yum` or `dnf clean all` in the same
  `RUN` directive as any `yum` or `dnf` command so that the metadata is not
  stored in the layer.
* Always document any inputs (via `--build-arg` or `-e`) required by
  `docker build` or `docker run`. This documentation should also clearly state
  any defaults that are used if no input is provided.
* If a custom value must be provided by the end-user, the build or run should
  gracefully fail if that value is not provided.
